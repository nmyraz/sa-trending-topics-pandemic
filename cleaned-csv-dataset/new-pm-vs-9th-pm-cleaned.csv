Dear new Pm I am not a fan and I strongly oppose your election as Prime Minister However I think it would be great if you could show to those who oppose you that they are incorrect or maybe you can continue to do the same things that you always do
picking a new pm is like picking what clothes you wanna wear

Is it really him as our new PM
I m not say that the new pm is not good but what for they force the pm resign when all the people in Malaysia is suffering they should think a way of helping Malaysians not just to get power
I only agree if this new pm gets rm 1800 salary monthly See how long he will last
i honestly wouldve k word myself if i was ismail sabri imagine being the new pm and the whole world is making you a laughingstock

Carol105Baker AussieVal10 Fighting a war needs intelligence and strategy not bravely jumping out and being quickly shot If he is gone a DS backed new PM will push everything into a deadly level
What will follow is that the new PM will appoint corrupt and or incompetent ministers in his cabinet as a reward for their loyalty and alliance Not on merit The vicious cycle will continue Pity the nation
Kita doakan yang baik2 je Insyaallah yg baik2 je jadi nanti 9th PM Malaysia Ismail Sabri
Ok so sh t happens I just want the new PM to exclude Azmin Hamzah and WAF from the cabinet and bring in the likes of Tok Mat Shahril Hamdan and couple of faces from PH which I think will happen PM9
Seeing so many politicians trying to jam their heads up the new PM s anus sickens me No wonder the last one got such a bad case of cirit birit towards the end
From a layman s view it is vital that whoever is selected as the 9th PM must possess excellent integrity as a leader to ride through the current situation and not based on party or MPs support especially when lives of its people are at stake with this killer virus in our midst
